# Cloud Deployment Resources

In the `/codebases` directory you'll find two apps...

- Simple Server
- Message Server

These are for use in the Cloud Deployment module. The intention is that you run these apps inside Docker containers. You _can_ also run them outside containers but that might require a bit of configuration.
